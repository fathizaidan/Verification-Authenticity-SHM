# TODO: Create Web UI for SHM Registry System

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Create frontend/ directory in project root
- [x] Create frontend/index.html with navigation and forms for all SHMRegistry functions
- [x] Create frontend/app.js for MetaMask connection and contract interactions
- [x] Create frontend/styles.css for basic responsive styling
- [x] Test UI by running local server and connecting to Hardhat network

## Notes

- Hardcode contract addresses in app.js (update as needed)
- Use ethers.js CDN for blockchain interactions
- Assume MetaMask is installed and user connects to localhost:8545
- Compute documentHash from file upload in Register SHM
- Display results and errors in UI
